<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Week 7 Progress Report</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Date:</b> 10/1-10/8/2023</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Total Hours:</b> 15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Description of Design Efforts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This week was focused on the mechanical and PCB design
elements of the project. Specifically for the mechanical design, this week was
devoted to the design of the gantry system for the newly delivered linear rail
bearings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>PCB Design (12 hours)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Schematic Redesign (5 hours)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Among other things, this week necessitated some revisions to
the schematic before moving into the layout portion of the system. Specifically,
I made the change to a single IC for the level translation and away from the
individual FET’s. The research for this ended up being much less straightforward
than I expected. After 2 trips to the ECE shop to look at their box of loose IC’s
(almost took a picture to attach here) I wasn’t able to find any surface mount
packages that were readily available there. Unfortunately, this meant I had to
search for a hand-solderable component online. Most 8 channel level translators
are only available in QFN and other no-lead packages. After roughly 2 hours of
research trying to find an active component with an accessible KiCad footprint,
I settled on the SN74AVC8T245 (which has a TSSOP 24 package).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Additionally, I added some connectors to the gantry limit
switches and IR sensors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PCB Layout (7 hours)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having done the (hopefully) final revisions to the schematic.
I began the PCB layout with the known static components. Note that I have hidden
the filled layers, but the front plane is 3.3V and the back is common ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pictured here are the STM32, the USB-&gt;UART converter, the
barrel connector, and the micro-usb jack. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Mechanical design (3 hours)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the linear rails delivered from Amazon, I began the gantry
design process with Chuck. Started by modelling the linear rails in CAD and the
grooves they will sit in on the table edges. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of the time spent here was the back and forth with
Chuck and others in the machine shop about the other work they are doing on the
corner pieces.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Week 6 Progress Report</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Date:</b> 9/25-10/1/2023</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Total Hours:</b> 6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Description of Design Efforts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This week was very light due to midterms and other elements
outside of this class that I had to take care of. Other than some mechanical
design, this week had no large time expenditure for design elements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Mechanical design and motor mounting</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5 of the 6 hours I had to spend on 477 this week were
devoted to getting the pulley system operational. This meant drilling and
cutting holes to accommodate the motor mountings done last week. These holes
needed to be cut through the surface of the table (but under the silver
edging). Unfortunately for me, the 85-degree angle of the sides of the table
meant that channels needed to be carved out in addition to the holes drilled in
the surface. Carving these channels took a significant amount of work (once
again, destroying my forearms) to remove enough material with a chisel without
compromising the integrity of the already weak particle board siding. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition to getting the motors fully mounted on the side
of the table, the corner connections for the pulley system needed to be drilled
out. The back-and-forth with the machine shop took ~4 hours of my time as we
decided the best mechanical method to suspend an idler pulley with enough
strength to support the tension of the system. Ultimately, we ended up carving
a channel for a large-bore (10mm) steel screw into the corners of the table.
This bore was, of course, much too large for the inner diameter of the idler
pulley, so we sunk a threaded hole into the middle of the large-bore screw.
Unfortunately, upon writing this the machine shop still has these components
due to a mis-drilling of the corner holes. A picture will be included for
reference in the week 7 report. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>PCB design work</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For roughly 1 of the 6 hours spent this week I fixed some
erroneous elements of the PCB along with taking the suggestions professor made
in lab. Top level perspective of the schematic looks relatively unchanged. But
I will include it here despite that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Date:</b> 9/18-9/24/2023</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Total Hours:</b> 10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Description of Design Efforts:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This week was primarily focused on getting the mechanical
systems mounted to the surface of the table along with continuing to sift
through documentation relevant to the PCB.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Mechanical Mounting Systems (6 hours)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trick with the mounting systems is that we want the
motors to be at adjustable heights. To support this functionality, I needed to
design a new bracketing system for the motors along with designing what
material will need to be removed from the table to accommodate this system. Below
is a drawing of the bracket system along with an image of what it will look
like when mounted on the table edging. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where the bracket is in white, the edging is in blue, and
the motor is in gray. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Notably the reason that this was a large time sink this week
was iterating on the design according to the recommendations of Chuck down in
the machine shop. Additionally, communicating with him to ensure that the
elements he was doing for us(namely drilling the holes in the table edging and potentially
fabricating the motor brackets in aluminum) were done with the correct dimensions
and constraints in mind. As of Friday afternoon when I am writing this, holes
have been drilled in one side of the table edging and will hopefully be ready
for pickup and remounting on Monday. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again, I spent ~2 hours under the table unscrewing the
siding. All 64 screws are now removed from the underside of the table. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>PCB Design and Documentation (4 hours)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Schematics for the PCB have been moving along smoothly, but
I spent a good deal of time reading documentation and datasheets for the micro,
the USB <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>à</span> UART converter, and the
LDO we plan on using. Additionally, worked with Abby to get better driving for
the 7-segment display. Using HC595’s will not work for our purposes because
they cannot source enough current fast enough. We will most likely be using the
DM13A or doing a transistor network to increase the current capacity of these
systems. As such, the PCB currently sits in the following state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Week 4 Progress Report</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Date:</b> 9/11-9/17/2023</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Total Hours:</b> 13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Description of Design Efforts:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This weeks primary focus was defining the interfacing
between each of the different subsystems. More specifically, deciding exactly
how the microcontroller will send out/receive data and which IO pins must be
reserved to accomplish this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>PC to Microcontroller (USB to UART) (4 hours)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Per Abby’s request, the PC would hopefully use the easily
accessible USB ports on the side of whatever computer we end up going with
(PowerPC? Powerful PC? Much debate on what we should call it). Abby seems to
already have the data transfer set up using USB, and John had mentioned that he
was using UART for another subsystem on the microcontroller so hopefully we can
proto before finalizing the PCB. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All that to say, it fell on me to research and layout the
USB <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>à</span> UART translator. My initial
thought with this was to go with the ECE362 module (FT232R chipset). After some
research, it appears this chipset is limited to 3 MBaud which I misinterpreted
to be a significantly slower data rate than it actually is. Normally I wouldn’t
include an error in a report, but my error cost me nearly an hour trying to
find a faster chipset before re-doing my math and realizing that 3MBaud would
have plenty of throughput for the application. See <a
href="https://www.wevolver.com/article/baud-rates-the-most-common-baud-rates">this
article</a> for learning process on baud rates. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After making this decision, I then found the footprint and
hooked it up into the current iteration of the PCB schematic. Note that I’ve
also added the JTAG programmer connection in the bottom right. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Microcontroller to 7 Segment Display (3 hours)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the heads-up display (HUD) we will be using the existing
but broken hardware that came with the table. Having done some low-cost
displays like this before, it fell on me to understand how to interface with
the existing PCB via the 2 8 pin connectors. Took about an hour in the lab with
the benchtop power supplies (and a good amount of research on the operating
voltages of the 7 segment displays to make sure I didn’t burn them out) to
reverse engineer my way into lighting the displays. Once this was done, I began
making a prototype connection to run this off of the microcontroller. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In short, the two 8 pin connectors are the display selector
and the segment selectors respectively. Meaning that if you pull the display
selector low (as the displays are common cathode) and n many of the segment selectors
high, you can turn on any n of the 7 segments in a single one of the displays.
For the control of this, we will therefore be exploiting persistence of vision to
briefly turn each display on in sequence in the required pattern for score
display. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To accomplish this, I have drawn up a simple SPI/shift
register interface for the microcontroller. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img border=0 width=624 height=377
src="mccutchc_files/image013.png"
alt="A screenshot of a computer&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that there will be an inverter after the display
selector, but I need to proto physically before designing in schematic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Other work (6 hours)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again did a bunch of work to sort physical issues out
on the table. Filling the original goal hole so that we can move it back was
almost the entire lab section this week. Once again, my forearms burn from the
physical labor involved in cutting the new surface to size. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was also responsible for the electrical overview, and
spent roughly 3 hours on that over the course of the week. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Total Hours:</b> 15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Description of Design Efforts:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Primary design focus for me this week was fleshing out the
design and ordering the parts for the CoreXY gantry system. However, most of my
hours this week were spent under the table removing 1.5in screws from the
underside of the table such that the mounting points for the motors could
actually be accessed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Additional work was also done setting up the PCB footprints,
baseline schematics, and power control systems for the microcontroller system. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Mechanical Systems Progress (3 hours)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As shown in week 2, the CoreXY system requires 2 motors, 6
idler pulleys, and a set of horizontal rollers. To minimize the number of belt
crossings to be done over the play surface, the motors will be mounted near the
center line of the table. </p>

alt="A diagram of a hockey game with Ice hockey rink in the background&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately for me, that meant removing the siding on the
edge of the table which, for obvious reasons, is very tightly screwed into the
structure of the table. Due to the angles at play on the underside of the
table, screws were inaccessible to a drill and had to be done manually. In
total removing the sideboards took nearly 6 hours and an intense arm workout. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>PCB Progress</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After deciding to use the STM32F091 microcontroller (the
same one used for ECE362), I was able to start doing preliminary setup for the
PCB power control and programming in KiCad. Immediately after writing this
report I will be communicating with the software side of our team to decide
whether we want to program on I2C or USART and will connect the programming
pins accordingly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that the PCB footprints still seem to be mapped
slightly incorrectly. F091 seemingly has some issues with the pin length on the
footprint. Will include in next week’s progress report once fixed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Total Hours:</b> 15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Description of Design Efforts:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This week’s primary task was to narrow the exact scope of
the project to write complete PSDRs, continue investigating the mechanical
systems to find the method of XY control, and start learning KiCad. The
narrowing of scope was a team effort and can be summarized by reading the A1
documentation on the group website. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Continuing investigation of mechanical systems</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the motors and motor power systems were set last week,
the actual arrangement of pulleys/gantry needed to be finalized this week.
Ultimately, we settled on the <a href="https://corexy.com/theory.html">CoreXY</a>
system for rapid motion in a 2D space. This method allows both motors to be
fixed in space (unlike a classical gantry system<b> </b>which requires one of the
two motors to be moved). Hopefully, this should allow for much faster
acceleration of the mallet on the surface of the table. Additionally, it is
important to note with this system that teethed belts and pulleys will be used
rather than cables and cable spools. This should increase the XY motion
accuracy of the system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Description of Design Efforts:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First week of the semester was fairly uneventful in terms of
actual design work. Primary task focused on setting up the course-required
website and design journals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Research of mechanical systems</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I took charge of mechanical systems research to find the
required torque, speed, and accuracy we need out of our stepper motors along
with the pulley/gantry arrangement and motor power/control systems. We are
hoping for a rough max acceleration of 20 m/s^2 and a max speed of 27.2 m/s
(60mph) while also maintaining a step accuracy down to .5 inches (I.E., one
step of the motor will produce .5 inches or less of linear motion). For this system,
I believe that I have settled on a <a

soft-symbolic links which are required for the functioning of the website as
windows sees them as a security threat. To re-enable the symbolic link requires
a linux command (<i>ln -s /web/entities/477grp16 web</i>). This can only be
accessed with ssh’ing into the 477grp16 machine, which must be accessed using
ssh to career account and then su to the 477grp16 account. </p>
